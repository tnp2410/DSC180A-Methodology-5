## Quarter 2 Project Proposal Brainstorming

### **What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

The most interesting topic covered this quarter is the integration of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) with data science techniques. I have learned how to apply machine learning models to spatial data, which can enhance predictions in various applications such as waste management and resource distribution.

### **Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

For my Quarter 2 project, I would like to investigate how GIS can be used to optimize waste collection routes using machine learning techniques. Specifically, I want to explore how traffic patterns, waste volumes, and geographic factors can be combined to predict the best collection routes for waste trucks, reducing fuel consumption and improving efficiency.

### **What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

In my Quarter 1 project, I focused on analyzing missed collection data for waste management. A potential change I would make is to incorporate real-time data from smart waste bins, which can notify when bins are full. This would allow for a dynamic adjustment of routes to avoid missed collections in the future.

### **What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

I would be interested in using deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to analyze spatial data for pattern recognition. I am also keen on exploring optimization algorithms to better adjust and fine-tune collection routes as conditions change.
