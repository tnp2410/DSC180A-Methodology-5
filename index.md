## Quarter 2 Project Proposal Brainstorming

### **What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

The most interesting topic this quarter is learning about multi-class classification and performance measurement techniques like AUC/ROC and accuracy. I also found the use of TF/IDF for feature creation and cross-validation to be valuable for building better machine learning models. These topics are exciting because they directly apply to the real-world problem of determining credit risk.

### **Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

For my Quarter 2 project, I would like to investigate how well different feature engineering techniques, such as creating balance and income-related features, can predict consumer credit risk. I plan to explore attributes related to spending, income, and balance over time, as well as test how different methods for feature selection impact the model’s performance.

Given the outflows and inflows datasets, I thought of a few related possible projects. One potential model is a cash flow prediction system that forecasts future income and expenses using time-series models like ARIMA or LSTM, leveraging time-based features such as the time of the month, seasonal trends, and transaction amounts. We could also create an anomaly detection model which identifys unusual spending or income patterns that indicates fraud or unexpected financial events, using methods like Isolation Forest or Autoencoders. A personalized budgeting recommendation system could be developed to suggest savings goals based on historical transaction patterns, utilizing collaborative filtering or content-based models.

### **What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

I would like to be more methodical in how I choose models and train the data. Specifically, I plan to apply a more structured approach to feature selection and model evaluation to ensure I’m choosing the best techniques for the problem. I’ll also experiment with different data processing strategies to improve model performance.

### **What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

In my project, I would explore different feature extraction tools to enhance model performance. For instance, I could use windowing to create time-series features, such as moving averages or differences between consecutive values. For text data, I might try tools like CountVectorizer to convert text into numerical features based on word frequency or Word2Vec for representing words in a high-dimensional space based on context. Additionally, I could apply log transformations to handle skewed data or use binning to group continuous values into discrete categories. These techniques would allow me to extract meaningful features from the data, improving the model’s ability to make accurate predictions.
